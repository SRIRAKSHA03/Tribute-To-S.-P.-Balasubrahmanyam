            <p> Sripathi Panditaradhyula Balasubrahmanyam also referred to as S. P. B was an Indian musician, playback
                singer, music director, actor, dubbing artist, and film producer who worked predominantly in Telugu, Tamil,
                Kannada, Hindi, and Malayalam films. Widely regarded as one of the greatest singers of India, He won six
                National Film Awards for Best Male Playback Singer for his works in four different languages; Telugu, Tamil,
                Kannada, and Hindi. According to some sources, he held the Guinness World Record for recording the highest
                number of songs by a singer with over 40,000 songs. He recorded 21 songs in Kannada for the composer Upendra
                Kumar in Bengaluru from 9 am to 9 pm on 8 February 1981. In addition, he recorded 19 songs in Tamil and 16
                songs in Hindi in a day, which has also been called a record.</p>
              <p>Even when he talks, he seems to sing. In whatever language you’ve heard him, and whatever kind of song you
                love him for, there’s no way you wouldn’t have heard an S.P. Balasubrahmanyam song if you’re an Indian,
                because he’s sung more than 40,000!.Despite a fabulous musical career spanning 49 years in the Telugu, Tamil,
                Kannada, Hindi, and Malayalam film industries, SPB remains down to earth.</p>
               
                <blockquote>I don’t know the ABCD of the theory of music. I don’t know how to write notations even now. I never
                    went to anybody to learn music. But I went to everybody to learn music — by listening to so many people!
